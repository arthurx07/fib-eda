This repository contains code which are solutions to the course **EDA 2024-2025 Q1** at [jutge.org](https://jutge.org).\
This repository is for personal use, and **if you are stuck with a problem I encourage you to keep trying**.\
If you are _**really really really**_ stuck you may look up the solution here :)\

_To clarify: the majority of the pdfs (problem statements) and samples are not created by me and proper credit should be given to its authors from jutge.org._
